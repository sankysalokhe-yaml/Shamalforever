<h2>Happy Valentine's Day ❤️</h2>
<p style="font-size:18px">Things change with time…
conversations, routines, timings.

But some comfort never really disappears.

You’ve always been a special kind of familiar to me —
the kind that doesn’t need constant talking
to still feel close.

Today just made me realise
I still like having you in my world.

No pressure, no big questions.

Just saying…
if we ever find our way back
to those easy conversations again,

I’d really smile at that.

Until then,
I hope your day feels warm, light
and a little extra special.

You deserve that. ❤️
